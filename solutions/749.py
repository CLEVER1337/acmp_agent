    # The number of non-trivial factorizations is (2k-1 choose 2)?
    # Actually, we can think combinatorially:
    # We have k copies of p and k copies of q.
    # Each factorization corresponds to a way to partition the multiset of primes
    # into at least two non-empty groups (factors).
    # But note: the order of factors does not matter (since multiplication is commutative),
    # and each factor must be greater than 1.
    
    # Alternatively, we can use the formula for the number of factorizations of a number
    # with prime factorization p^k * q^k.
    
    # Actually, we can model this as:
    # For each factor, it is of the form p^a * q^b, where 0<=a<=k, 0<=b<=k.
    # But the factorization must be such that the product of factors gives n.
    
    # However, a more combinatorial approach:
    # The number of non-trivial factorizations (with order not mattering) is equal to
    # the number of ways to partition the multiset of exponents.
    # Specifically, we have two independent sets: k copies of p and k copies of q.
    # The factorizations correspond to partitions of the set of exponents into subsets (factors).
    # But note: the factors are unordered, and the entire factorization is unordered.
    
    # Actually, we can use the concept of Bell numbers, but for multisets.
    
    # Alternatively, we can derive:
    # Consider the exponents for p and q separately.
    # For the p's: we need to partition k identical items into groups (each group corresponds to the exponent of p in a factor).
    # Similarly for the q's.
    # Then, each factorization is determined by a pair of partitions: one for p and one for q.
    # However, the factors are combined: a factor is p^a * q^b.
    # So if we have a partition of the k p's into m groups: a1, a2, ..., am (sum ai = k, each ai>=1)
    # and a partition of the k q's into m groups: b1, b2, ..., bm (sum bi = k, each bi>=1)
    # then we get factors: p^{a1}q^{b1}, p^{a2}q^{b2}, ..., p^{am}q^{bm}.
    # But note: the number of groups m must be the same for both.
    # And the factors are unordered.
    
    # However, the problem counts factorizations like 2*50 and 50*2 as the same (since order doesn't matter).
    
    # Actually, the number of non-trivial factorizations (with at least two factors) is:
    # Let F(k) be the number of ways to partition the multiset.
    # We can use recurrence.
    
    # But there is a known result: for n = p^k * q^k, the number of factorizations is the number of pairs (a,b) such that a*b = k? Not exactly.
    
    # Another idea: the number of factorizations is equal to the number of distinct divisor pairs (d, n/d) with d>1, n/d>1, and also factorizations with more than two factors.
    # However, the problem includes factorizations with any number of factors (>=2).
    
    # Actually, we can use generating functions.
    
    # After reading known combinatorial results:
    # The number of multiplicative partitions of n = p^k * q^k is equal to the number of integer partitions of k multiplied by the number of integer partitions of k, but then adjusted for the fact that the factors are combined.
    # Specifically, if we have a partition of k for p: k = a1 + a2 + ... + am
    # and a partition of k for q: k = b1 + b2 + ... + bm
    # then we get a factorization with m factors: (p^{a1}q^{b1}) * (p^{a2}q^{b2}) * ... * (p^{am}q^{bm})
    # But note: the same partition of k can be used for both.
    # However, the factors are unordered, so we need to count distinct multisets of factors.
    
    # Actually, it is known that the number of multiplicative partitions of n = p^k * q^k is the number of matrices of nonnegative integers with row sums and column sums all equal to k, up to permutation of rows and columns? Not sure.
    
    # Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming.
    
    # However, after reading the example: n=100=2^2*5^2 has 8 factorizations.
    # For k=2, the answer is 8.
    
    # How to compute for general k?
    # Actually, the number of non-trivial factorizations is equal to the number of ways to partition the exponent set for both primes simultaneously.
    # It turns out that the number is equal to the number of groups of divisors that cover all exponents.
    
    # There is a direct formula: the number of factorizations is the number of pairs (i,j) such that i*j >= k? Not sure.
    
    # Another approach: the number of factorizations is the number of ways to choose factors that are divisors of n, such that the product is n and each factor>1.
    # But counting unordered factorizations is hard.
    
    # Actually, we can use the following idea:
    # The number of multiplicative partitions of n is given by the function f(n) which can be computed recursively.
    # But n can be up to 10^18, so k can be up to about 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18).
    
    # We can compute the number of factorizations for n = p^k * q^k using recursion on k.
    # Let F(k) be the number of factorizations of p^k * q^k.
    # Then we have recurrence:
    # F(k) = sum_{a=1}^{k} sum_{b=1}^{k} F(k - a, k - b) ? Not sure.
    
    # After some research, it is known that the number of multiplicative partitions of n = p^k * q^k is equal to the number of bipartite graphs with both vertex sets of size k, up to isomorphism? Not sure.
    
    # Alternatively, we can use the formula from the example: for k=2, answer=8.
    # For k=1: n=p*q, which has only one non-trivial factorization: p*q. So answer=1.
    # For k=3: we can try to compute manually.
    
    # Actually, there is a closed form: the number of factorizations is the number of integer partitions of k multiplied by itself, but then summed over the number of factors.
    # But wait: for each number of factors m (from 2 to 2k), we need to count the number of ways to have m factors.
    
    # However, from the known example:
    # k=1: partitions of 1: [1] -> one partition. So if we take one partition for p and one for q, we get one factorization: p*q. But also we can have factors that are not prime powers? In this case, the only factor is p*q.
    # So for k=1, answer=1.
    # k=2: partitions of 2: [2], [1,1].
    # If we take [2] for p and [2] for q: we get one factor: p^2*q^2.
    # But this is trivial (only one factor), so not counted.
    # [2] for p and [1,1] for q: factors: p^2 * q * q = p^2 * q^2? Not, we need to assign: actually, we need to have the same number of groups.
    # So for two factors: we can have:
    #   p's partitioned as [1,1] and q's as [1,1]: factors: (p*q) * (p*q)
    #   p's as [1,1] and q's as [2]: not allowed because number of groups must be the same.
    # So actually, the partitions must have the same number of parts.
    # So for m=2: we can have both partitions as [1,1] -> one way.
    # For m=3: not possible because we only have exponent 2 to split.
    # For m=4: [1,1] for both, but that gives4 factors? Not.
    
    # Actually, the correct way is: for a factorization with m factors, we need to assign to each factor a pair (a_i, b_i) such that sum a_i = k, sum b_i = k, each a_i>=0, b_i>=0, and the product of the factors is n.
    # But since the factors are unordered, we need to count multisets.
    
    # After reading the solution from known sources:
    # The number of non-trivial factorizations is actually equal to the number of ways to choose divisors d of n such that d>1 and n/d>1, but also including factorizations with more than two factors.
    # But for n = p^k * q^k, the number is equal to the number of pairs (i,j) such that 0<=i<=k, 0<=j<=k, and we have factors: p^i * q^j.
    # However, this counts each factor.
    
    # Another idea: the number of factorizations is the number of ways to split the exponents that is the number of integer solutions to:
    #   a1 + a2 + ... + am = k
    #   b1 + b2 + ... + bm = k
    # for some m>=2, and then divided by symmetries.
    
    # Given the complexity, and since k is not too large (<=60), we can use dynamic programming to count the number of factorizations.
    # We will define dp[i][j] = number of ways to factorize p^i * q^j into factors ( unordered).
    # Then we have:
    #   dp[0][0] = 1
    #   dp[i][j] = sum_{a=0}^{i} sum_{b=0}^{j} dp[i-a][j-b] * [ if (a,b) is chosen as a factor]
    # But note: to avoid double-counting, we need to ensure that the factors are non-increasing or something.
    
    # Alternatively, we can use recursion with memo.
    # Since k<=60, we can do it.
    
    # Actually, we can use a different recurrence:
    # Let F(s, t) be the number of factorizations of p^s * q^t.
    # Then F(s,t) = sum_{a=0}^{s} sum_{b=0}^{t} F(s-a, t-b) for a>0 or b>0, but with the condition that the factor p^a * q^b is used, and to avoid order, we require that the factors are non-decreasing in some sense.
    # To avoid order, we can require that the factors are generated in non-decreasing order.
    
    # We will use: 
    #   F(s,t) = sum_{a=0}^{s} sum_{b=0}^{t} [ if (a,b) != (0,0)] F(s-a, t-b) 
    # but only if the factor p^a * q^b is at least as large as the previous factor? Not easy.
    
    # Given the time, I will use the known answer for the example and derive a formula.
    # From examples:
    # k=1: answer=1
    # k=2: answer=8
    # What is the pattern?
    # 1, 8, ...?
    # Perhaps it is (2k-1)^2? For k=2: (3)^2=9, but we have8.
    # Or maybe it is the number of divisors of k^2? For k=2: divisors of4 are1,2,4 ->3, not8.
    
    # After thinking, the number of factorizations is actually equal to the number of ways to choose a divisor d of n that is between p^0 * q^0 and p^k * q^k, but that's not helpful.
    
    # I recall that the number of multiplicative partitions of n = p^k * q^k is equal to the number of labeled bipartite graphs with both parts of size k, up to isomorphism? Not sure.
    
    # Given the time, I will output the solution that works for small k.
    # Since k is small (<=60), we can use recursion with memo.
