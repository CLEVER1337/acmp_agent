The notation of a chemical reaction always contains descriptions of several substances. In turn, the description of a single chemical substance is a string in which the constituent atoms of chemical elements are listed in a specific order. In this case, sequences of two or more identical atoms in a row are grouped: the abbreviated name of the chemical element is written, followed by the number of identical consecutive elements. For example, H2 is written instead of HH. The designations of chemical elements consist of one or two English letters, the first being uppercase and the second lowercase. This task will not consider more complex rules. For example, parentheses are not used. You must check that a given sequence of characters fits the above description of a chemical substance formula. It is not necessary to consider the correctness of the given string based on any other reasoning, even if dictated by common sense.

Input
A single line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a non-empty sequence of characters consisting only of digits and lowercase and uppercase English letters. It is guaranteed that in the sequence, each lowercase letter is preceded by an uppercase one, and all one-letter and two-letter substrings starting with an uppercase letter are correct designations of chemical elements (therefore, their list is not even provided here). The length of the sequence is from 1 to 1000 characters.

Output
Output a single word, YES, to the output file OUTPUT.TXT if the given string fits the simplified description of a chemical substance formula from the condition, and NO if it does not.
