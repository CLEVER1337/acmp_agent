Recently, Bill got a job as a police officer. Now he has to patrol his beat every evening, which is a rectangle consisting of N×M blocks. Each block is a 100 by 100 meter square, and the blocks are separated by straight streets. Thus, Bill's beat is crossed by N+1 streets running west to east and M+1 streets running north to south. The intersections break the streets into (N+1)*M + (M+1)*N segments, each 100 meters long. During his patrol, Bill starts from the police station located near the southwest corner of his beat, patrols the area, and returns to the station. While on patrol, Bill must walk each street segment within his territory at least once. It is known that Bill covers a 100-meter segment in one minute. Determine the minimum number of minutes Bill needs to complete the patrol. The input file INPUT.TXT contains natural numbers N and M not exceeding 10,000. Output the minimum time required for Bill to complete the patrol to the output file OUTPUT.TXT. One of the possible optimal paths for Bill in the second example is shown in the figure.
