A multiplication table is a table of n rows by m columns, where at the intersection of the i-th row and j-th column is the number i∙j (rows and columns are numbered starting from one). One of the math schools decided to conduct a pedagogical experiment. To make it easier for students to memorize the multiplication table, some numbers in it will be painted red, some blue, and some green (the remaining numbers will be black). The process of coloring the numbers can be roughly divided into four stages. In the first stage, all numbers are painted black. In the second, all even numbers are painted red; in the third, all numbers divisible by 3 are painted green; in the fourth, all numbers divisible by 5 are painted blue. The school principal wants to know how many printer cartridges need to be purchased for printing the tables. Therefore, he needs information about how many numbers of each color will be in one colored n by m multiplication table. Write a program that solves the problem of counting the corresponding quantities.
Input data
The input file INPUT.TXT contains two natural numbers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000).
Output data
On the first line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT, output the number of numbers painted red; on the second - green; on the third - blue; on the fourth - black. Follow the format given in the examples.
