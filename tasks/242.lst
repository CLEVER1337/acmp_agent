After Aunt Polly's surprise at her fence being painted, she tasked Tom Sawyer with repainting the tiles that paved their square yard. The yard was covered with N×N identical square tiles, each of which had long ago been painted one of K colors (K < N). The paint on the tiles had faded, and Tom Sawyer was tasked with repainting them, this time in any one color (from the same K colors). All tiles needed to be painted, including those that had already been painted that color before. By dipping the brush into a bucket of paint once, one horizontal or vertical row of tiles could be repainted. To diversify his work, Tom decided that a row of tiles could only be painted with a color that was currently already painted (with old or new paint) on at least two tiles of the selected row (vertical or horizontal). At one time, Tom intends to paint the entire row with an allowable color, regardless of whether any of its tiles have been repainted before. Help Tom determine the minimum number of times he will have to dip the brush to repaint all the tiles, following the invented rules, and in what color all the tiles will end up being painted.
Input
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains two numbers separated by a space: N — the number of tiles in one row (1 < N ≤ 200) and K (1 ≤ K < N). Each of the next N lines contains N natural numbers representing the color numbers of the paints in which the corresponding tiles of this horizontal row were once painted. Color numbers are natural numbers in the range from 1 to K.
Output
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, output two numbers: L — the minimum number of times the brush will have to be dipped into the paint bucket, and the paint number C, in which all the tiles of the yard will end up being repainted. If there can be several such paints, output any one of them. If it is impossible to repaint all the tiles following Tom's invented rules, output the number 0 twice.
