"Secondary sorting workshops receive bottles of N types: A, B, C, … (first N uppercase letters of the alphabet). Bottles arrive in processing lots of N containers, and in each container, there can be bottles of various types. Before secondary processing, workers sort the bottles by type so that, after sorting, each of the incoming containers has no more than one type of bottle, and each bottle type is in no more than one container. Each container can hold an unlimited number of bottles. You need to write a program that determines the minimum number of moves required to sort the bottles by type, where each move can relocate a single bottle from one container to another.
Input data
The input file INPUT.TXT consists of N+1 lines. The first line contains the number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 8). The second line contains N integers separated by spaces, representing the number of bottles of type A, B, C, … in the first container. Subsequent lines contain similar information for the second, third, …, N-th container respectively. It is known that the number of bottles in each container does not exceed 32767.
Output data
The output file OUTPUT.TXT should consist of two lines. The first line presents a permutation of the first N uppercase letters of the alphabet, indicating the type of bottles that might be found in the 1st, 2nd, …, N-th container after sorting. The second line provides the number determining the required minimum number of bottle moves. If multiple solutions are possible, any of them can be provided."
