In a gym measuring N×M meters, a modern attraction called the "Left Maze" was built. To do this, lines parallel to the gym walls were drawn on the floor at 1-meter intervals. Thus, the gym was divided into N×M cells. Then, some of these cells were painted black. The attraction consists of placing a participant in a certain cell of the gym and asking them to run to another specific cell as quickly as possible. The following conditions apply:
It is known that moving from one cell to an adjacent one takes exactly 1 second. The task is to calculate the minimum time required for the participant to reach the target cell.

Input
The input file INPUT.TXT first contains the number K — the number of allowed right turns (an integer from 0 to 5), followed by the numbers N and M, specifying the dimensions of the gym — natural numbers not exceeding 20. Then, N lines follow, each containing M numbers. The number 0 denotes an unpainted cell, the number 1 — a painted cell, the number 2 — the starting cell of the participant, and the number 3 — the target cell (cells marked 2 and 3 are unpainted). The maze always has exactly one starting cell and exactly one target cell.

Output
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, output the minimum time required to reach the target cell. If it is impossible to reach the target cell, output –1.
