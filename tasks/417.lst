When processing various information, it is often necessary to operate with date data. In this task, you need to write a program that can output the day of the month, the month, and the day of the week that will occur K days after January 1, 2008. Recall that this was a Tuesday.
The input file INPUT.TXT contains a single integer K (0 ≤ K ≤ 1000) - the number of days after January 1 when the date of interest will occur (or occurred).
Input data
