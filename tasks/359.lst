Boy Vasya in math class, instead of listening to the teacher, was drawing numbers in his grid notebook. And he wasn't just drawing them randomly, but in a specific way. First, he wrote the number 1 in a cell. Then to the right of it, he drew the number 2. Then below the number 2, he wrote the number 3. Then he moved to the cell to the right and continued his fascinating activity moving up the column until the number in this column became higher than the topmost number in the previous column. Then he moved to the cell to the right and again continued drawing numbers, starting with 7, but this time from top to bottom, until he drew a number that was one cell below the bottommost number in the previous column. And so on. Vasya didn't like numbers ending with zero, so he skipped them while drawing his snake. We copied his first six filled columns from his notebook and show them here in the figure. Since Vasya is very curious, he really wants to know what number will be in the N-th column in the row where the number 1 is. The first 6 such numbers in this row are visible in the figure: 1, 2, 5, 8, 14, 19. You are required to write a program that will help Vasya.
Input
The input file INPUT.TXT contains one number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6) – the column number.
Output
The output file OUTPUT.TXT should contain the N-th number in the row where the number 1 is located.
