Two players are playing. A certain date in 2008 is set. On their turn, each player names a later date, increasing either the day of the month or the month by 1 or 2, but not both at the same time. The combination of day and month must remain a valid date. The player who names December 31st loses. Both players play optimally. Based on the given date, output who will win.
Input data
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains numbers representing the day and month. The month is specified from 1 to 12, the day from 1 to the number of days in that month; the date "December 31" is not present in the input data.
Output data
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, output 1 if the first (starting) player wins, or 2 otherwise.
