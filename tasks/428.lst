The SMS messages of the MOBILA mobile phone are composed of uppercase English letters. If the letter is the first on the button, you need to press this button once to add the letter to the message. If the letter is the second, you need to press the button twice, and so on. So, to type the word "SMS", you need to press (PQRS)(PQRS)(PQRS)(PQRS)(MNO)(PQRS)(PQRS)(PQRS)(PQRS). To enter two letters located on the same button, you need to pause between key presses. For example, to enter the message "AA", you need to press (ABC)(pause)(ABC). If a button has three letters, then as soon as such a button is pressed three times, the last letter is added to the message immediately, and the subsequent presses of the same button refer to the next letter of the message. Similarly, if a button has four letters, then after four presses, the last letter will be added to the message. That is, the press sequence (ABC)(ABC)(ABC)(ABC)(pause)(ABC) corresponds to the message "CAA". Unfortunately, mobile phones of this model have long been out of production, and only one such phone remains. It can arbitrarily insert and ignore pauses during message input, which can lead to some changes in the messages. For example, when entering MOSCOWQUARTERFINAL, you might get OMSCMNWQTTARTERDEINAL instead. You received an SMS message and know that the original message contained N letters. To determine the probability of guessing the original message, find the number of possible messages that could have turned into the one you received.
Input
The input file INPUT.TXT in the first line contains the length of the original message N (1 ≤ N ≤ 80). The second line contains the received SMS message, consisting only of uppercase English letters with a length from 1 to 80.
Output
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, output the number of messages of N letters that, when typed on this phone, could have turned into the given message.
