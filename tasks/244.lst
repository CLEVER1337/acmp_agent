During the installation of turnstiles in buses, the developers encountered the problem of ticket authenticity verification. To solve it, the following method of protection against counterfeits was devised. The information recorded on the ticket is encoded with K numbers (0 or 1). At the same time, a sequence of N numbers (N ≥ K) is written directly on the ticket so that the numbers written at a distance of K match. Thus, to verify the authenticity of a ticket, it is sufficient to check that all numbers at a distance of K match. Unfortunately, errors can sometimes occur when reading information from a ticket — it is assumed that one of the numbers may be distorted (i.e., 0 is replaced by 1, or 1 by 0). Such a ticket should still be considered authentic. In all other cases, the ticket is considered counterfeit.
Write a program that, based on the information read from the ticket, determines its authenticity and indicates which number might have been misread.
Input
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the numbers N and K (1 ≤ N ≤ 50000, 1 ≤ K ≤ 1000, K ≤ N). The second line contains N numbers, each of which is 0 or 1 — the information read from the ticket.
Output
The first line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT should contain OK if the ticket is authentic and FAIL if it is counterfeit. If the ticket is authentic, output 0 on the second line if all numbers were read correctly, or the number of the digit where a reading error might have occurred. If there are several possible distorted numbers, output the smallest of them.
