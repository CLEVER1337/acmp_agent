In many trading firms, there is a position known as a procurement manager. As is known, they are responsible for purchasing goods according to a trading plan, which is essentially a list of product names, each with the required quantity. They purchase these items from wholesale bases. The trading plan is created by the company's management. Sometimes, procurement managers may wish to bring not only their firm but also personal benefit. A new wholesale base recently opened right after the signing of the latest trading plan for ordering n types of goods. As often happens after a new base opens, their prices for many goods are lower than those in the plan. Probably, this can be utilized. Funds were allocated for purchasing goods under the assumption that all goods would be purchased from the old wholesale base. The manager wants to utilize this opportunity to purchase goods from the new base and spend as little money as possible on buying the required amount of goods (of course, the unspent money can be taken by him). To avoid raising strong suspicions, purchasing goods from the new base should not exceed a total planned cost of d monetary units. It remains only to calculate which goods and in what quantities should be purchased from the new base to leave as much unspent money as possible. 

The first line contains four numbers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), d, and k1 and k2 (1 ≤ k1, k2 ≤ 1000) — the number of product names available on the previously opened and the new base, respectively. Following this, there are n lines, each containing the name of a product in the plan and its quantity (a positive real number). Then come two blocks of k1 and k2 lines respectively, separated by the preceding ones and from each other by a newline — the product names on the bases and the prices per unit of product, respectively. All prices are positive numbers, even on the new base.

Input data  
Product names consist of up to 100 English letters and underscores, and the case of letters is not considered. Real numbers are given up to two decimal places and do not exceed 10^6 in magnitude. It is guaranteed that all planned products can be purchased from the old base. Assume that any product can be bought in any fractional quantity on any base, and that when paying, any fractional amount of monetary units can be used.

Output data  
Output n real numbers in the OUTPUT.TXT file, one per line, specifying the amount of each corresponding product to be purchased from the new base. On the i-th line, output the quantity of the i-th product planned. Errors less than 0.01 will be ignored.
