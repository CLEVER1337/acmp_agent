A robotic warehouse has n compartments where the robot can place cargo. Compartment number i has a capacity ci. Cargo number i has a size si, arrives at the warehouse at time ai, and is picked up from the warehouse at time di. The compartment capacity and cargo size have the same unit. If a compartment with capacity c contains several cargoes with a total size d, then the free space in this compartment is c – d.When cargo number i arrives at the warehouse, the robot first tries to find a compartment that has enough free space to accommodate this cargo. If there are several compartments with sufficient free space, the robot places the cargo in the one with the least free space. If there are several such compartments, the robot chooses the compartment with the smallest number.If there are no compartments with sufficient free space, the robot attempts to relocate cargo already placed in the compartments. To do this, it tries to find a compartment and a cargo within it such that moving it to another compartment would free up enough space to place the incoming cargo. If there are several such relocation options, the one that requires moving the cargo with the smallest size is chosen. If there are still several options, the option is chosen where the free space in the compartment from which the cargo is moved is minimized after moving that cargo; if conditions are still equal, the option where the free space in the compartment to which the cargo is moved is also minimized after the relocation is chosen. If more than one option remains after this, the option with the smallest number of the cargo being moved and the smallest number of the compartment to which it is moved is chosen. If no option to relocate a single cargo is found, the cargo is not accepted into the warehouse.It is required to write a program that, based on the list of cargoes arriving for placement in the warehouse, outputs the sequence of actions performed by the robot.InputThe first line of the input file contains two integers: n — the number of compartments, and m — the number of cargoes (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100). The second line contains n integers ci, specifying the capacities of the compartments (1 ≤ ci ≤ 10^9). The subsequent m lines describe the cargoes: each cargo is described by three integers: its size si, its arrival time at the warehouse ai, and the time it is picked up from the warehouse di (1 ≤ si ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ ai < di ≤ 1000, all times in the input file are distinct, and the cargoes are ordered by increasing arrival time). All numbers in the lines are separated by a space.OutputOutput the sequence of the robot's actions in the order they are performed. Follow the output file format given in the example. The following messages are possible:
