In the land of Olympiadia, elections are being held again. The country consists of small counties. Counties are united into confederations. Each confederation once a year chooses a patron for itself – one of the 200 priests. This ritual is called the Great Priest Re-elections and proceeds as follows: confederations simultaneously submit applications (one per confederation) to the Council of Priests stating whom they would like to see as their patron (if no application is submitted, it is considered that the confederation wants to keep the same patron). After that, all applications are satisfied. If several confederations choose the same Priest, they permanently merge into one. Thus, each Priest is always the patron of no more than one confederation. It is required to write a program that allows the Council of Priests to find out the number of the patron Priest for each county after the Great Re-elections. In the Council, all counties are numbered (starting from 1). All Priests are numbered from 1 to 200 (some of them may not be anyone's patrons at the moment).
The input file INPUT.TXT contains the number N – the number of counties in the country (1 ≤ N ≤ 5000) – and then for each county, the number of the patron Priest of the confederation it belongs to is recorded (counties are considered in the order of their numbers). Then the applications from the confederations are specified. First, the number M – the number of submitted applications – is written, and then M pairs of numbers (1 ≤ M ≤ 200): the first number is the number of the current patron Priest, the second is the number of the desired patron Priest.
