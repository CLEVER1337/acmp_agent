For given natural numbers N and K, it is required to compute the number of integers from 1 to N that have exactly K zeros in their binary representation. For example, if N=8 and K=1, we can write all numbers from 1 to 8 in binary: 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, and 1000. From this, we can see that only the numbers 10, 101, and 110 have exactly one zero, meaning the correct answer is 3.
Input
The single line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains two natural numbers N and K separated by a space, not exceeding 10^9.
Output
The single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT should contain a single integer — the number of integers from 1 to N with K zeros in their binary representation.
