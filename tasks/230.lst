The dark realm is an N×M labyrinth where some cells are surrounded by mirror walls and the rest are empty. The entire labyrinth is also surrounded by a mirror wall. A traffic light was placed in one of the empty cells of the labyrinth, emitting beams in 4 directions at 45 degrees relative to the labyrinth walls. It is required to depict the trajectory of these beams. When a beam reaches a corner where mirror walls pass through, it continues as shown in the figures (cells surrounded by mirror walls are shown in gray). The beam behaves similarly when it reaches the labyrinth boundary.

Input
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains two natural numbers N and M — the number of rows and columns in the labyrinth (each number is at least 1 and at most 100). The next N lines contain exactly M characters each — the labyrinth map. The symbol * (asterisk) denotes a cell surrounded by mirror walls, . (dot) — an empty cell, and the symbol X (uppercase English letter X) — the cell where the traffic light is located (there is exactly one such cell).

Output
Output N lines of M characters each to the output file OUTPUT.TXT — an image of the labyrinth with beam trajectories. Here, as before, * (asterisk) should denote cells surrounded by mirror walls, . (dot) — empty cells through which light beams do not pass, / (slash) — cells through which a light beam passes from the bottom left to the top right (or vice versa — from top right to bottom left), \ (backslash) — cells through which a beam passes from the top left to the bottom right (or vice versa), and the symbol X (uppercase English letter X) — cells through which beams pass along both diagonals.
