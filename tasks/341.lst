Dima recently started working at the "Numerical Sequences" Research Institute. As the name of the institute implies, its main focus is conducting various research in the field of numerical sequences.
Recently, the head of the department where Dima started working encountered a very interesting sequence of numbers a1, a2, …, an, … while solving one of the problems, which is defined as follows: a1 = 0 and each subsequent number ai (1 < i ≤ n) is defined as the smallest larger natural number whose decimal representation does not contain any digits present in the decimal representation of ai-1.
It is required to write a program that calculates the value of an for a given number n.
Input data
