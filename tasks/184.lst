Ivan Ivanovich is a very responsible but very absent-minded person. Therefore, when he starts a new task, he writes the start date and time on a separate piece of paper (for example, 29.01. 10:30), and when he finishes, he writes the end date and time on a separate piece of paper (for example, 02.02. 12:15). The papers are neatly stacked one on top of the other. And since Ivan Ivanovich can only do one task at a time, the papers are uniquely ordered in the stack: the start paper of a task, the end paper of that task, the start paper, the end paper... and so on. A task starts at the beginning of the minute indicated on its start paper and ends at the end of the minute indicated on its end paper. Ivan Ivanovich goes to work every day, and his working day lasts from 10:00 to 18:00. Thus, the pair of papers "18.11. 15:13" — "20.11. 10:27" was written at the start and end of a task lasting 11 hours and 15 minutes.
One day at the end of December, the cleaning lady Dusya accidentally dropped this stack on the floor and, not knowing the important pattern of their arrangement, collected the papers back in some arbitrary order. Ivan Ivanovich discovered this unfortunate fact only on December 31, when he needed to account for his working time for the year. The year was not a leap year.
Help Ivan Ivanovich find his total time spent for the year.
Input
The input file INPUT.TXT contains the number of papers K in the first line (K is an even number, not exceeding 5000). Then K lines follow with data on the papers in the format DD.MM. hh:mm, where DD is the day, MM is the month, hh is the hour, and mm is the minutes.
Output
The output file OUTPUT.TXT should contain an entry of the form h:mm - the number of hours and minutes worked by Ivan Ivanovich. In this case, the number h ≥ 0 is output without leading zeros, and the number 0 ≤ mm ≤ 59 is output with leading zeros.
