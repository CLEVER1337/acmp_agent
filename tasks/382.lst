The labyrinth is a square consisting of N×N segments. Each segment can be either empty or filled with a solid stone wall. It is guaranteed that the top-left and bottom-right segments are empty. The labyrinth is surrounded by walls on the top, bottom, left, and right, leaving only the top-left and bottom-right corners free. The director of the labyrinth decided to paint the walls visible from the inside (see the picture). Help him calculate the amount of paint needed for this.
