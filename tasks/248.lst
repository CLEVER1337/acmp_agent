The European Commission plans to decide that English will become the official language of the European Union. A plan to simplify English spelling has also been developed and is planned to be implemented over four years.
The first priority will be to eliminate the letter c, which in combinations with i and e will be changed to s, in the combination ck will be omitted, and in other cases replaced by k. All replacements will be made in strict order from left to right. For example, in the word "success", the first of the two letters c will be replaced by k, and then the second by s, resulting in "suksess". And the word "cck" will turn into "kk".
In the second year, all double letters will be removed from English words: ee will be changed to i, oo to u, and in other combinations, simply one letter will be written instead of two identical ones. Such replacements will also be made strictly in order from left to right. So, the word "ooo" will turn into "uo", and "oou" will simply become "u" (in it, first oo will be replaced by u, and then uu by u), the word "iee" will turn into "i" (in it, first ee will be replaced by i, and then ii by i).
In the third year, the letter e will be dropped at the end of a word if it is not the only letter in the word.
Finally, the completion of the reform will be the abolition of articles (there are three articles in English: a, an and the). These articles will be deleted only when they were the words a, an, the in the original text. For example, the text "the table" after the reforms of the first three years will become "th tabl", and after the reform of the fourth year - simply "tabl". And the word "aaaaa" after the reform of the first years will become the word "a", but since it was not originally the word a (an article), it will ultimately remain the word "a".
Write a program that will translate classical English text into Euro-English.
Input
The input file INPUT.TXT contains one line of text, consisting of no more than 200 characters: English lowercase and uppercase letters, spaces and punctuation marks (the text may contain: period, comma, question mark and exclamation mark, colon, dash, semicolon, opening and closing parentheses, apostrophes, quotation marks). Uppercase letters can only appear at the beginning of a word. Nowhere can two spaces appear in a row. There cannot be a space at the beginning or end of a line. Words are separated from each other by spaces and/or punctuation marks.
Output
The output file OUTPUT.TXT should output the converted string under the constraints:
