During recent excavations on Mars, sheets of paper with mysterious symbols were discovered. After extensive research, scientists concluded that the inscriptions could actually be ordinary numerical equalities. Furthermore, from other sources, compelling evidence was obtained that Martians knew only three operations - addition, multiplication, and subtraction (Martians never used the "unary minus": instead of "-5" they wrote "0-5"). Scientists also proved that Martians did not assign different priorities to operations but simply evaluated expressions (if they contained no parentheses) from left to right: for example, 3+3*5 equaled 30, not 18. Unfortunately, the arithmetic operation symbols have faded. For example, if the inscription was "18=7 (5 3) 2", it might be possible to reconstruct it as "18=7+(5-3)*2". It is required to write a program that finds the required arrangement of signs or reports that none exists.
Input data
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT consists of a natural number not exceeding 230, an equals sign, and a sequence of natural numbers (no more than ten) whose product also does not exceed 230. Some groups of numbers (one or more) may be surrounded by parentheses. The length of the input string will not exceed 80 characters, and there are no other restrictions on the number and nesting of parentheses. Between two adjacent numbers not separated by parentheses, there will always be at least one space; in all other places, there may be any number (including zero) of spaces (naturally, there are no spaces within numbers).
Output data
The output file OUTPUT.TXT must contain one line with the obtained equality (i.e., the original equality with inserted arithmetic operation signs without extra spaces). If the required arrangement of signs is impossible, output a line consisting of the single number "-1". The output line must not contain spaces.
