This year Ivan Ivanovich decided to mark the arrival of autumn with a community work day to clean up all the trash in the yard of house number 31 on Autumn Street. For the work day, he invited N elderly lady acquaintances living in the very same house. However, right at the start of the event, it became clear that the elderly ladies work poorly on their own because they also want to talk to each other while working. Ivan Ivanovich thought about it and made an executive decision to split the elderly ladies into groups so that each group would have at least 2 elderly ladies. The elderly ladies differ from each other in their level of talkativeness, and if two elderly ladies end up in the same group, one with a low level of talkativeness and the other with a high level, they won't be able to talk to each other and the work will stall.
Let's call the talkativeness of a group the difference between the maximum and minimum levels of talkativeness of the elderly ladies in the group. For example, if the levels of talkativeness of the elderly ladies in a group are 7, 3, and 11, then the talkativeness of the group is 11 - 3 = 8. The talkativeness of a partition of the elderly ladies into groups is defined as the maximum of the talkativeness values of the groups comprising the partition.
We need to write a program that will help Ivan Ivanovich find a partition of the elderly ladies into groups for which the talkativeness is minimized.
Input data
The input file INPUT.TXT contains the number N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000) – the number of elderly ladies – in the first line. The second line contains N numbers from 1 to 10^9 – the talkativeness levels of the elderly ladies.
Output data
The output text file OUTPUT.TXT must contain a single integer, which is the minimum possible talkativeness of the partition of the elderly ladies into groups.
