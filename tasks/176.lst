A string consisting of the characters '(' and ')' is called a bracket sequence. A bracket sequence is called correct if it can be obtained from some valid arithmetic expression by removing all characters except parentheses. For example, the correct bracket sequence "(())()" can be obtained from the expression "(2-(3+4)*6)*(1+1)". The depth of a correct bracket sequence is the maximum difference between the number of opening and closing brackets in a prefix of the sequence (a prefix of a string S is a string that can be obtained from S by removing some number of trailing characters; for example, the prefixes of the string "ABCAB" are "", "A", "AB", "ABC", "ABCA", and "ABCAB"). For example, the depth of the sequence "()()(())" is two, because the prefix "()()((" has 4 opening and 2 closing brackets. It is required to write a program that determines, given the values N and K, the number of correct bracket sequences with N opening brackets that have a depth equal to K.
Input data
The input file INPUT.TXT contains the integers N and K (1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 50) in a single line, separated by a space.
Output data
The output file OUTPUT.TXT must contain a single number — the number of correct bracket sequences with n opening brackets that have a depth of k.
