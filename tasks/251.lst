For playing Kalah, several small boxes arranged in a circle are used, containing balls. A move is carried out as follows. All balls are taken from one box and are then distributed one by one into the boxes in sequence, starting from the next one clockwise. If there are more balls than boxes, the process continues (the balls are distributed along the second circle, the third, etc.) until all balls are distributed. Balls are also placed into the box from which they were taken. An example of one move is shown in the figure. On the right, the balls are numbered in the order they were distributed into the boxes.
Petya, training before the competition, distributed the balls among the boxes arbitrarily and began making arbitrary moves. After each move, he recorded the number of the box into which the last ball was placed. At some point, he decided to restore the initial configuration from the final one and the records he had made. Write a program that will help him with this.
Input data
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains two natural numbers: N ≤ 100 — the number of boxes and M ≤ 100 — the number of moves Petya made. The boxes are numbered sequentially clockwise from 1 to N. The next N lines (or one line separated by spaces) contain the number of balls in the first, second, ..., Nth box in the final configuration. The next M lines (or one line separated by spaces) contain the numbers of the boxes into which the last ball was placed on the first, second, ..., M-th move, respectively. The total number of balls does not exceed 10^9.
Output data
The output file OUTPUT.TXT should contain N numbers: the initial number of balls in the first, second, ..., Nth box.
