It is well known that in the army, drill training and order are essential and are strictly enforced. One morning, a sergeant lined up all his subordinates in K rows of N soldiers each, but it turned out that the soldiers were not arranged by height, so the sergeant decided to punish them. The soldiers had to line up by height in each individual row so that the shortest would be on the left and the tallest on the right. And since in the army the weak (short) are always to blame, the punishment was as follows: each soldier had to do as many push-ups as the number of soldiers to his left who were taller than him.
It turned out that all the soldiers were of different heights, and many had to do push-ups quite a number of times. The sergeant became curious: how many push-ups did the soldiers have to do in total?

Input
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains two natural numbers N and K (2 ≤ N ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ K ≤ 20) – the number of soldiers in each row and the number of rows. The next K lines of the file contain exactly N distinct natural numbers from 1 to N – the heights of the soldiers. The first number in the row is the height of the first soldier (the leftmost in the row), the second is the height of the second, and so on.
Output
The output file OUTPUT.TXT should contain the total number of push-ups the soldiers had to perform.
