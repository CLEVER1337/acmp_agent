In the modern world, everything is becoming digital. Shamans in a fairy-tale northern country are also trying to keep up with the times. Recent research has shown that long ropes woven from walrus whiskers can be used with great efficiency as material components for witchcraft. Each rope encodes a magical integer as follows: first, it is divided in a specific way into parts corresponding to the digits of the magical number, in each of which from zero to nine knots can be tied (globalization forces shamans to use the ordinary decimal number system). Of course, this may require very long ropes to represent very large numbers. Hopefully, the introduction is clear to you. A shaman of tribe X has cast a curse on tribe Y. The shaman of tribe Y managed to find out which magical number N was used in the terrible ritual. Now he needs to create a rope with a number K such that N + K is divisible by the fundamental magical constant M. This must be done as quickly as possible, so he wants to accomplish the task by tying the smallest number of knots, even if it requires taking the longest rope from the secret storage. Will you help save tribe Y (and perhaps, after it, the whole world) from the terrible shaman of tribe X?
Input
The input file INPUT.TXT contains two integers – N and M. Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 1000, 1 < M ≤ 1000.
Output
The output file OUTPUT.TXT should contain a non-negative integer K – the answer to the problem.
