Petya found an online puzzle game called "Bug" at http://buglab.ru. In this game, participants are required to build a maze for a bug in such a way that the bug takes as long as possible to find the exit. The bug always starts moving from the top-left corner, and the exit is always located at the bottom-right. The bug does not move optimally but rather as follows: it moves to a cell where it has either never been or has been the least number of times. Specifically, as the bug passes through each cell of the maze, it remembers how many times it has visited that cell. When deciding its direction of movement at any given moment, it checks how many times it has visited the cell below, to the right, to the left, and above, and moves to the cell it has visited the least. If multiple directions have the same minimum number of visits and one of them coincides with its current direction of movement, it does not change direction. Otherwise, it moves according to the following priorities: down, right, up, left. For example, if the minimum number of visits is both to the right and left (while it was moving up or down), the bug will go right because "right" has a higher priority. It should be noted that, using this algorithm, the bug will always reach the exit if the exit exists.

After studying the bug's movement algorithm, Petya wants to write a program that, for a given maze, determines the number of moves the bug makes before reaching the exit. Help Petya implement this program!

Input
The input file INPUT.TXT contains integers N and M separated by a space in the first line - the number of rows and columns in the maze (4 ≤ N, M ≤ 100). This is followed by N lines describing the maze row by row. Each line contains M characters - the cells of the maze for the current row, where the "@" symbol denotes a wall, and a space " " denotes an empty space. It is guaranteed that the maze boundaries are surrounded by walls. The bug is assumed to start moving from coordinate (2, 2) and finish at coordinate (M-1, N-1), and it is implied that there are no walls at these coordinates. It is guaranteed that if an exit from the maze exists, the bug will be able to exit it in no more than 107 steps.

Output
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, output the number of moves the bug makes if a rescue route exists for the bug, and -1 otherwise.
