Given a natural number N. It is required to represent it as the sum of two natural numbers A and B such that the GCD (greatest common divisor) of A and B is maximized.

Input
The input file INPUT.TXT contains a natural number N (2 ≤ N ≤ 10^9).

Output
Output the two sought numbers A and B to the output file OUTPUT.TXT. If there are multiple solutions, output the one where A takes the smallest possible value.
