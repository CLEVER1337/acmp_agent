A game for two players is defined by its tree. The opponents take turns making moves. The first player starts the game. The game ends either in a draw or with a victory for one of the players. The leaves of this game tree can have values equal to one of three numbers: +1 - victory for the first player, -1 - victory for the second player, 0 - a draw. Your task is to determine who will win if both opponents follow the correct strategy.

Input
The tree nodes are numbered with consecutive integers. The root of the tree always has number 1. The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a natural number N - the number of nodes in the game tree (N ≤ 1000). The next N - 1 lines describe the nodes - one line for each node (except the first). The second line contains a description of the second node of the tree, the third - the third node, and so on. If a node is a leaf, the first character of the line is L, followed by a space, then the number of the parent node, another space, and the result of the game (+1 - victory for the first player, -1 - victory for the second, 0 - a draw). If the node is internal, the line contains N - the first character, then a space and the number of the parent node.

Output
Output to the file OUTPUT.TXT +1 if the first player wins, -1 if the second wins, and 0 in case of a draw.
