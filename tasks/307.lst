Rhythmic gymnastics is a sport where everything is learned through comparison; here, unlike in running or swimming, an athlete's result cannot be measured to the hundredth of a second. Therefore, judges assign scores to the performances at competitions. When scoring, judges not only consider the current performance but also inevitably compare it to performances given earlier. Additionally, the complexity of the routine and the athlete's ranking are taken into account.
Each performance by an athlete is described by two numbers: the athlete's ranking number (the most professional athletes have the highest number) and the number of the performed routine (routines are numbered starting from the simplest). The judge compares each athlete's performance with every performance that occurred before it. If the comparison results in an athlete with a higher number performing a simpler routine than an athlete with a lower number, the judge is surprised. It should be noted that a single performance can surprise the judge multiple times. One athlete can perform several times, just as one routine can be performed by several athletes – however, such performances do not surprise the judge when compared. An athlete does not perform the same routine again.
The task is to calculate how many times the judge will be surprised during the competition.
Input
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the number of athletes N (0 < N ≤ 250), the number of routines M (0 < M ≤ 250), and the number of performances P. The following P lines each contain two numbers describing an athlete's performance – the athlete's number and the routine number.
Output
Output to the file OUTPUT.TXT how many times the judge was surprised.
