The user is viewing a table in Internet Explorer and uses the mouse wheel to scroll the image. In doing so, the entire image shifts up or down by T pixels. The user strongly dislikes when the mouse cursor ends up on the horizontal lines separating the table rows. Therefore, he wants to choose a position for the mouse cursor on the screen such that during scrolling to the end of the table, the cursor intersects with the table lines as few times as possible.
In this case, if at some position the cursor is on two table lines, it is counted as two intersections of the cursor with the table lines. If the mouse cursor crosses a certain line in two positions (for example, if the cursor height is 10 pixels, and the table shifts by 7 pixels during scrolling, then the mouse cursor might be on the same line in two scrolling states), this is also counted as two intersections.
The monitor screen has a vertical resolution of U pixels. The coordinates are set so that the topmost points of the screen have coordinate 0, and the bottom ones have coordinate U–1. The mouse cursor has a height of H pixels. The cursor's position is defined by its topmost point. Thus, if we say it is positioned, for example, at point with coordinate 0 on the screen, then its image is located in points with coordinates from 0 to H–1. The mouse cursor always fits entirely on the screen, meaning the valid coordinates for its position range from 0 to U–H. The table the user is viewing has a height of L pixels and consists of N–1 rows, and consequently, has N horizontal lines with coordinates X1, X2, …, XN. Here, 0 = X1 < X2 < X3 < … < XN = L–1.
At the initial moment, the table is positioned so that the line with coordinate 0 in the table is displayed in the 0th row of the monitor's pixels. Then, during scrolling, the table shifts by T pixels each time (i.e., the row of pixels with coordinate T in the table appears in the 0th row of the monitor, then coordinate 2T, etc.). This continues until the bottom line of the table (which has coordinate XN) appears on the screen. After that, no further scrolling occurs (if initially XN < U, then no scrolling occurs at all).
Input data
The input file INPUT.TXT first specifies the vertical resolution of the monitor U, then the height of the mouse cursor H, then the scrolling step T. Next, the height of the table L is given. Then the number of dividing lines in the table N is specified, and the coordinates X1, X2,…,XN where these lines are located relative to the start of the table. Constraints: 10 ≤ U ≤ 512, 1 ≤ H ≤ U, 1 ≤ T ≤ U, 2 ≤ N ≤ 200000, 0 = X1 < X2 < X3 < … < XN = L–1 ≤ 10^9.
Output data
The output file OUTPUT.TXT should contain the smallest possible number of intersections between the mouse cursor and the table lines.
