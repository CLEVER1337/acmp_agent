An enterprising and very attractive lady with the most charming name, Gorgona, decided to earn money for a luxurious life. N young men are so in love with her that they have proposed marriage. Unfortunately for them, Gorgona sees them only as bags of money. She plans to marry and then almost immediately divorce some of the young men for financial gain. All she needs is to earn as much money as possible (and, of course, remain unmarried). According to the laws of this beautiful country, in a divorce, each spouse receives half of all property.
