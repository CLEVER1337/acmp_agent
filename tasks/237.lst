Petya is solving a puzzle that works as follows. Given a square grid of size N×N, where each cell contains an uppercase English letter, and a list of keywords. Petya needs to take each keyword and find it in the grid. This means finding all the letters of the word in the grid such that the cell containing each subsequent letter of the word is adjacent to the cell containing the previous letter (cells are considered adjacent if they share a side—i.e., they are adjacent vertically or horizontally). For example, the figure shows how the word "olympiad" can be located in the grid.
When Petya finds a word, he crosses it out of the grid. Letters that have already been crossed out cannot be used in other keywords. After all keywords have been found and crossed out, several letters remain in the grid, from which Petya must form the word encrypted in the puzzle.
Help Petya solve this puzzle by writing a program that, given the grid and the list of keywords, outputs the letters Petya should use to form the word, i.e., which letters remain in the grid after crossing out the keywords.
Input
The input file INPUT.TXT contains two numbers: N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10) and M (0 ≤ M ≤ 100). The next N lines contain N uppercase English letters each, describing the grid. The next M lines contain the keywords. The words consist only of uppercase English letters, and each word has a length between 1 and 100 characters. It is guaranteed that all keywords can be found and crossed out from the grid according to the rules described above.
Output
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, output the remaining letters from the grid in alphabetical order.
