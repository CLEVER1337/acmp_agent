The Fibonacci numbers are constructed as follows: the first two are ones, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. For example, the first ten Fibonacci numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55. In the given text, the characters are numbered from left to right, starting with one. The task is to write a program that forms a word from characters whose positions coincide with the Fibonacci numbers.
