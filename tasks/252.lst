As is well known, Russia is one of the leading exporters of oil. Various countries around the world, from fairly large to relatively small, need this oil like air. It contains large quantities of aromatic hydrocarbons, which determine its high quality. The oil is delivered to its destination via a pipeline. It is believed that the amount of oil sent to the destination country equals the amount of oil received. In reality, of course, this is not the case. Like many other things, oil is stolen by some unscrupulous individuals. Moreover, it is unofficially believed that more oil is stolen from the pipelines of those countries to which more oil is sent (perhaps the unscrupulous individuals believe they cause less damage this way, who knows...). The official management of the company "Russian Oil" decided to find out whether this rumor is true or not, in order to strengthen (or perhaps just establish) security on those pipelines where the most oil is stolen. To do this, they need to sort the pipelines by the amount of oil flowing towards a particular country per day. The company "Russian Oil," like any self-respecting company, has several in-house programmers, and the management asked them to solve this, in essence, simple task. But the programmers were stumped by the fact that the data on the amount of oil is presented in different units of measurement (ranging from grams to tons). Therefore, they decided to find someone who could solve this problem for them and promise to hire this person for this promising and thriving company. Solve the problem, and who knows, maybe you will be the lucky one?
Input
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) — the number of pipelines. Each of the next N lines contains the quantity (more precisely, the mass) of oil transported via the corresponding pipeline per day, one per line. The mass of oil is given as an integer from 1 to 10000 with the corresponding unit of measurement. The number and the unit of measurement are separated by exactly one space. The unit of measurement is specified by one of three letters: g (grams), p (poods), t (tons), and before this letter there may be one of the prefixes: m (milli-), k (kilo-), M (mega-), G (giga-). Recall that these prefixes denote multiplication of the unit of measurement by 10–3, 103, 106, and 109, respectively. 1 pood = 16380 grams, 1 ton = 106 grams.
Output
Output N lines to the output file OUTPUT.TXT, which should contain the masses of oil in non-decreasing order. Each line should describe the mass of oil in one of the pipelines. The masses should be described in the same format as they are written in the input file. The priority of equal masses recorded in different formats should correspond to the order in which they appear in the input file.
