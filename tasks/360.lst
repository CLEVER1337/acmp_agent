In a given two-dimensional integer array of size N × N, find three elements with the maximum sum. The first element must be adjacent horizontally or vertically to the second, and the second must be adjacent to the third.
Input
The input file INPUT.TXT contains the integer N (1 < N ≤ 2000) in the first line. The next N lines each contain N numbers – the elements of the array. The elements of the matrix do not exceed 100 in absolute value.
Output
The output file OUTPUT.TXT must contain a single number – the maximum sum.
