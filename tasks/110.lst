Sasha finds numbers beautiful if their decimal representation contains no digits other than 0 and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 9). For example, if k = 2, such numbers would be 2, 20, 22, 2002, etc. Sasha doesn't like other numbers, so he represents them as a sum of beautiful numbers. For example, if k = 3, the number 69 can be represented as: 69 = 33 + 30 + 3 + 3. However, not every natural number can be decomposed into a sum of beautiful integers. For example, with k = 5, the number 6 cannot be represented in this way. But if we use beautiful decimal fractions, it can be done: 6 = 5.5 + 0.5. Recently, Sasha learned about periodic decimal fractions and started using them as terms as well. For example, if k = 3, the number 43 can be decomposed as: 43 = 33.(3) + 3.(3) + 3 + 3.(3). It turns out that any natural number can be represented as a sum of positive beautiful numbers. But such a decomposition is not unique—for example, the number 69 can also be represented as 69 = 33 + 33 + 3. Sasha became interested in the minimum number of terms required to represent the number n as a sum of beautiful numbers. You are required to write a program that for given numbers n and k finds the decomposition of n into a sum of positive beautiful numbers with the minimum number of terms. The input file INPUT.TXT contains two natural numbers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ k ≤ 9). Output the decomposition of n into a sum of positive numbers containing only digits 0 and k, with the minimum number of terms, to the OUTPUT.TXT file. The decomposition should be presented in the form: n=a1+a2+...+am. The terms a1, a2, ..., am should be output without leading zeros, without extra zeros at the end of the fractional part. The representation of each term should be such that the lengths of the period and pre-period of the fractional part have the minimum possible length. If there are multiple solutions, output the one with fewer terms and, if possible, with the fewest numbers with a periodic fraction. For example, the following numbers are incorrectly output: 07.7; 2.20; 55.5(5); 0.(66); 7.(0); 7. ; .5; 0.33(03). They should be output as: 7.7; 2.2; 55.(5); 0.(6); 7; 7; 0.5; 0.3(30). The pre-period and period of each output number should consist of no more than 100 digits. It is guaranteed that at least one such solution exists. If there are multiple desired solutions, output any. The order of the terms can be arbitrary.
