Game rules: Initially, there is a pile containing N stones on the table. Two players take turns taking stones from the pile. If the pile contains K stones before a player's move, that player can take from 1 to [sqrt(K)] (the integer part of the square root of K) stones, inclusive. For example, if the pile has 10 stones, the player is allowed to take 1, 2, or 3 stones. If no stones remain in the pile, the player whose turn it is to move loses. The task is to determine: can the first player win if both players follow an optimal strategy?

Output
