" In today's time, creators of office applications strive to do everything for user convenience. Therefore, even such a small detail as the representation of lists of numbers on the screen, for example, for displaying page numbers, must be carefully designed. You must implement a function that, given a set of integers, will form a string that is its shortest textual representation. The textual representation is a string consisting of numbers separated by commas and ranges formatted as <a, ..., b>, which are used to record sets of all numbers from a to b. However, all numbers included in the string must be ordered in ascending order, following the sequence they appear in the string.  

Input data  
The input file INPUT.TXT contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) — the size of the set. The second line contains N integers describing the set, separated by spaces, each with an absolute value not exceeding 10000. A number may appear multiple times in this description.  

Output data  
Output one of the shortest textual representations of the given set of numbers. Pay attention to correct spacing. In the example, the output file contains exactly four spaces."
